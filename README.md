This project implements a banking system with account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers while ensuring balance validation through a custom BalanceException. It supports multiple account types, including an Interest Rewards Account, which adds a 5% bonus on deposits, and a Savings Account, which applies a $5 withdrawal fee. Transactions are secure, with real-time balance updates and structured exception handling to prevent overdrafts.
